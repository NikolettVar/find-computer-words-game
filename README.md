# find-computer-words-game
Higher Diploma in Computing, Software Development, Software Development module.
This project was created as an end-of-semester exam.
At the start of each round, the application randomly selects 12 letters from the 
English alphabet and displays the 12 letters to the players.
The 12 letters do not have to be unique (i.e. the same letter can be randomly 
selected multiple times at the beginning of a certain round).
Next, each player takes turn to try to make a word using as many of the 12 letters as the player can 
but using each letter only once. 
Input validation is required according to the rules of the game, including the following rules:
The word has to be formed only from the 12 letters randomly selected for that round (i.e. no 
other letters can be used).
The words provided by the players have to be valid computer-related words in English. Each 
time a player enters a word the game must check the word against an array of valid words.
